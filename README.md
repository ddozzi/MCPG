## Information
Basically just Hippo's [GradleMCP](https://github.com/Hippo/GradleMCP) with a few minor tweaks. Created this repo for myself in order to fix a few bugs but decided to make it public. Dont plan on adding support for Windows but might add support for 1.8.9 if I feel like it. Its basically the same thing.

## Note to self

Set project SDK to Coretto 1.8.302 and JDK to 8 (3) 1.8.292
